# Live Project
## Introduction
I recently did my first live project with the Tech Academy for the Software Developer Bootcamp. I was given the opportunity to do a two  week sprint with a team of instructors and peers. We continued work on an ongoing project creating apps designed to take advantage of various Python and Django features. Within the scope of this project we created databases to keep track of data, implemented CRUD functionality and interacted with APIs to retrieve and save data. This project was built utilizing Python, Django, SQLite, and HTML/CSS. This was my first opportunity to work with a tech team in a profesional environment and it was very exciting. I was able to complete both [front end stories](#front-end-stories) and [back end stories](#back-end-stories) as well as being able to gain and work with some valuable project management [skills](#skills) that I'm sure will come in handy in the future.

## Front End Stories
  - [Build The Basic App](#build-the-basic-app)
  - [Front End Imporovements](#front-end-imporvements)

### Build the Basic App
For this story I had to create an app using the Django framework that could track my hobby data as well as displaying a home page with basic content. This included a Navbar, Background, Title and Footer. This would be the base of every page for the project
