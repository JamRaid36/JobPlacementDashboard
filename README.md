# Live Project
## Introduction
For two weeks, I worked on my first live project sprint with a team of instructors and peers. We continued work on an ongoing project creating apps designed to take advantage of various Python and Django features. Within the scope of this project we created databases to keep track of data, implemented CRUD functionality, interacted with APIs to retrieve and save data. This project was built utilizing Python, Django, SQLite, and HTML/CSS. This was my first opportunity to work with a tech team in a profesional environment and was very exciting. While I was able to work several stories dealing with [Front End](#front-end) and [Back End] I was also able to gain valuable project management skills.
